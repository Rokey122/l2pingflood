# l2pingflood

Simple python script to preform a l2ping flood attack. It uses bluetoothctl to scan for nearby bluetooth devices and saves them so that you can select which ones to attack. Was tested on a bt speaker and works well.

# Usage

**Works only on linux with sudo privileges**

In a terminal window run:
```
sudo python3 l2pingflood.py
```
